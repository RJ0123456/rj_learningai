## What is a Perceptron? – Basics of Neural Networks
### An overview of the history of perceptrons and how they work.
A single-layer perceptron is the basic unit of a neural network. A perceptron consists of input values, weights and a bias, a weighted sum and activation function.

Represented visually we see (where typically the bias is represented near the inputs),

Let’s also create a graph with two different categories of data represented with red and blue dots.

we see that a perceptron can do basic classification using a decision boundary.
