**Note** Data is like the oil of industry for **AI**<br>

The ImageNet project is a large visual database designed for use in visual object recognition software research. More than 14 million[1][2] images have been hand-annotated by the project to indicate what objects are pictured and in at least one million of the images, bounding boxes are also provided.[3] ImageNet contains more than 20,000 categories,[2] with a typical category, such as "balloon" or "strawberry", consisting of several hundred images.[4] The database of annotations of third-party image URLs is freely available directly from ImageNet, though the actual images are not owned by ImageNet.[5] Since 2010, the ImageNet project runs an annual software contest, the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), where software programs compete to correctly classify and detect objects and scenes. The challenge uses a "trimmed" list of one thousand non-overlapping classes.[6]

## Significance for deep learning
On 30 September 2012, a convolutional neural network (CNN) called AlexNet[7] achieved a top-5 error of 15.3% in the ImageNet 2012 Challenge, more than 10.8 percentage points lower than that of the runner up. Using convolutional neural networks was feasible due to the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) during training,[7] an essential ingredient of the deep learning revolution. According to The Economist, "Suddenly people started to pay attention, not just within the AI community but across the technology industry as a whole."[4][8][9]

In 2015, AlexNet was outperformed by Microsoft's very deep CNN with over 100 layers, which won the ImageNet 2015 contest.[10]

## History of the database
AI researcher Fei-Fei Li began working on the idea for ImageNet in 2006. At a time when most AI research focused on models and algorithms, Li wanted to expand and improve the data available to train AI algorithms.[11] In 2007, Li met with Princeton professor Christiane Fellbaum, one of the creators of WordNet, to discuss the project. As a result of this meeting, Li went on to build ImageNet starting from the word database of WordNet and using many of its features.[12]

As an assistant professor at Princeton, Li assembled a team of researchers to work on the ImageNet project. They used Amazon Mechanical Turk to help with the classification of images.[12]

They presented their database for the first time as a poster at the 2009 Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in Florida.[12][13][14]
